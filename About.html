                <!--Here in the footer tag i have used 'P' instead of using the heading tag which is 'H1, H2 ,H3 & etc', the reason for that is because
                once i use a 'H' tag by default a padding gets added around the text so that the length of the footer and the design gets cluttered even though
                i try to specify the height. so i have use 'p' tags which are usually being used to pharagraphs but i assigned classes indiviually for those 
                and applied stylings in the CSS sheet-->
